*********

For the X clone, instead of placing data-fetching logic directly inside the FeedPage component, a useFeed custom hook can be created. This hook would be responsible for:

Managing state variables for loading, error, and the array of tweets.

Using an useEffect hook to fetch tweet data from an API when the component mounts.

Returning functions that allow the component to interact with the data, such as postTweet or likeTweet.

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function StaleCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const logCountLater = () => {
    // This function creates a "closure" and remembers the value of `count`
    // at the moment it was created.
    setTimeout(() => {
      alert(`The count was: ${count}`);
    }, 3000);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      
      {/* This button updates the state, causing a re-render */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
      
      {/* This button schedules the log with the CURRENT version of logCountLater */}
      <button onClick={logCountLater}>
        Log Count After 3 Seconds
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
Try this sequence:

Click the "Log Count" button once. The count is 0. You've scheduled an alert with a function that remembers count as 0.

Immediately click the "Click me" button 5 times. The UI will update to show "Current Count: 5".

Wait 3 seconds. The alert will pop up and say: "The count was: 0".

This is the stale data bug in action. The function that setTimeout is holding onto is a "photocopy" from the first render, when count was 0. It has no idea that the state has since changed.

This is exactly why the useEffect dependency array is so important. It's React's way of ensuring your effects always use the "freshest photocopy" of your functions and variables from the latest render.
